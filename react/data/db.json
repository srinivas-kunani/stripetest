The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "title": "Is blogging still relevant in 2023?",
      "body": "As a small business owner or entrepreneur, you may be wondering if blogging is still a relevant marketing tool in 2023. \nWith so many changes in technology and society over the past few years, it’s understandable to question whether or not something like blogging is still an effective marketing strategy. \nThe simple answer is yes! Blogging can be an extremely powerful marketing tool when used correctly. In this guide, I’ll share my top five reasons why blogging is still a relevant and effective marketing strategy in 2023.\nWhy you should start blogging today\nBuild Presence and Authority\nBlogging is a powerful tool for building presence and authority in your industry. By consistently creating valuable content that answers common questions and provides reliable information, you establish yourself as an expert and gain the trust of your audience. This trust can increase conversions and sales, as customers are more likely to do business with brands they trust. Here’s what research conducted by Hubspot recently found:\n\n“Our research suggested that most consumers read blogs multiple times per week and have purchased something from a brand after reading the company’s blog.” \nLet’s look at an example from one of my clients; a Mental Health Training Business fills its blog with informative posts about managing mental health in the workplace, how employers can support their employees, and the latest industry research, showcasing its expertise and building loyalty with its audience. Additionally, they use blog posts to answer specific questions and position themselves as helpful resources to prospects, further building trust.\nBy putting out valuable content consistently and following the E-A-T concept of expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness, blogging can help you establish yourself as a leader in your industry.\nImprove Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)\nLike with blogging, many people still question whether SEO is still relevant in 2023 (I’ll be covering that soon), but again the simple answer is yes.\nIt’s more important than ever that potential clients can find your business online, and blogging is an effective way to improve your website’s SEO. By regularly creating keyword-rich blog articles that are optimised for search engines such as Google, your website can rank higher in organic search results, resulting in more traffic and leads.\nAs another example, one of my clients is a Talent Consultant, helping businesses recruit diverse and innovative teams. Their most recent blog is currently sitting at Number 2 on Google Search Results for an article discussing ageism in the workplace, a trending topic in the HR space right now.\nConsistent blogging also keeps your website fresh, which search engines favour. By incorporating tactics such as keyword research, link building, optimising headings, titles, and meta descriptions, and adding internal links to each post, you can improve your website’s page authority and rank higher in search results pages (SERPs).\nAdditionally, blogging about your business, product, or service will naturally increase your search keywords. You can further boost your search keyword rankings by utilising specific keywords about your product or service.\nRead More: Getting started with keyword research.\nOverall, maintaining a blog can significantly improve a website’s SEO and attract more leads to your business.\nIncrease Web Traffic and Sales\nBlogging is an effective tool for increasing web traffic and conversions. By providing valuable and keyword-rich content related to your audience’s needs and interests, you can attract more visitors to your site. Regularly updating your blog with new products or services and discounts and promotions can also boost your lead generation strategy. Each blog post is a new opportunity to generate leads and convert website traffic into paying customers. By including lead-generating call-to-actions in each post, such as free ebooks or webinars, visitors can exchange their contact information for valuable content assets. Remember, not all blog readers will become leads. Still, the more frequently you post quality content, the more opportunity you have for higher traffic and conversions. So get blogging, put calls to action on every post, and strive to improve your visitor-to-lead conversion rate each month.\nDevelop Customer Relationships\nBlogging is an excellent way for you to build stronger relationships with your customers:\nBy blogging, you provide valuable information to your customers that can help them make informed buying decisions. This helps establish trust and credibility with the audience, which is essential for building lasting relationships.\nBlogging allows you to engage in meaningful conversations with your target audience. This can be achieved by posting videos, news, data, and exciting trends related to the industry. And by doing this, you can demonstrate your expertise and build trust with your audience.\nBy creating an active comment section below your blogs and responding quickly to your readers, you can develop a sense of belonging and community, further strengthening the relationship with your customers.\nIn summary, regular blogging can help you foster stronger connections with your audience by providing valuable information, engaging in meaningful conversations, and building trust and credibility.\nMake Money\nOk, maybe this should have been Number 1… Blogging has become a popular way for individuals and businesses to earn extra income, and not just by generating leads. You can attract a loyal following by creating valuable content that solves problems or educates readers on topics related to their interests. And there are several ways you can monetise this, including:\nSponsored posts\nAffiliate marketing\nSelling digital or physical products\nFor example, one of my clients is an Amazon Affiliate. They have built a popular site dedicated to giving reviews and the latest information on all types of smart tech, with product links in their blogs. If a reader clicks on a product link and goes on to buy that product, my client makes a commission from Amazon.\nNow you know precisely why blogging is so powerful; you might have some questions about getting started, so here are the answers to some of the most common questions I hear…\nWhat are the FAQs about blogging?\nDo I need to invest money to start a blog?\nStarting a blog does not necessarily require a large investment of money. You only need a domain name and web hosting service, which you can get for less than £60 per year. Additionally, web hosting platforms such as Bluehost make it easy to create and manage a WordPress blog without needing any technical knowledge or coding experience. While there may be additional expenses, such as hiring a writer or purchasing premium themes or plugins, these are not necessary for starting a basic blog. But as we’ve seen above, investing in a blog can have numerous benefits for your business.\nWhat kind of content should I write?\n To create compelling blog content, it’s essential to understand your audience and create content that is both engaging and valuable.\nRead More: Knowing your ideal client is key to creating copy that converts.\nThis can be achieved by incorporating images, infographics, and videos, and breaking up heavy blocks of text with subheadings. Providing in-depth, well-researched content that explores a topic from multiple angles can also help establish your brand as an authority in your industry.\nExperimenting with different types of content, such as listicles, how-to guides, and case studies, can help determine what resonates best with your audience. Ultimately, the key to successful blogging is to focus on quality over quantity and provide content that is both informative and engaging.\nHow often should I blog?\nTo maximise the benefits of blogging as a marketing tool, you should aim to post consistently. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, posting at least once a week is a good starting point. However, it’s important to prioritise quality over quantity.\nRather than posting for the sake of posting, focus on creating high-value content relevant to your target audience. This will help attract and retain readers, establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry, and ultimately drive traffic and conversions to your website.\nHow long should each post be?\nWhen using a blog post as a marketing tool, it is vital to keep in mind the attention span of readers. Studies show that people tend to read blogs with titles between 6-13 words and prefer shorter sentences and paragraphs. As a rule of thumb, limit each sentence to one thought to make it more digestible.\nTo keep readers engaged, break up heavy blocks of text with multimedia elements such as images, infographics, tweets, and videos. In terms of length, the ideal range of words for a blog post is between 600-1,600 words. However, longer articles can be broken down into smaller, more readable sections with well-thought-out headers and lists to make it easy for readers to skim through.\nHow can I increase my blog’s traffic?\nTo increase your blog’s traffic, there are three key strategies you should focus on:\nCreate valuable and shareable content that will attract new visitors and keep them coming back for more.\nOptimise your blog for search engines by using specific keywords and publishing fresh content regularly. This will improve your search engine rankings and make it easier for people to find your blog.\nPromote your blog through social media and other channels to reach a wider audience.\nShare your blog posts on social media and include share buttons on your website to encourage readers to spread the word. Following these strategies can increase your blog’s traffic and attract more potential customers.\nConclusion\nSo there you have it, all the reasons you need to start or reignite your business blog. Not only is it still a powerful marketing tool, but it’s also a great way to connect with your audience and build relationships.\nIf you’re thinking of starting a blog, be sure to create content that is valuable and relevant to your audience, and if you want expert results, feel free to drop me a message; I’d love to have a chat about how I might be able to help you reach your business goals.\nAs a content and copywriter, helping businesses attract and nurture their ideal clients to grow their sales is what lights me up.

      "title": "What is a Blog Post? – The Perfect Structure",
      "body": "Headline\nThe headline, or title, of your blog post, has to capture the attention of potential readers. People may see it in their social media news feed or search results. Make sure you include the main keyword phrase that people could use when searching for the topic you are covering.\n\nPublish date\nPublish date of your content is optional but recommended. If you frequently update your blog, post dates can help your visitors to determine the recent posts. It’s not that important on evergreen content pages but is often used on daily published content.\n\nAuthor by-line\nAn author by-line helps readers identify who wrote the content and is particularly important for blogs with many writers. Furthermore, the author by-line could give your content more trust if a recognized writer creates it.\n\nPost category\nCategory classes used to group your content into distinct sections. It’s recommended to use category tags for each blog post you create. Grouping relevant content together will be helpful to your visitors and to search engines crawl your blog.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first paragraph of your blog post will either keep people reading or make people leave. Make sure that it compels people to read the rest of your content. You should use your targeted keyword phrase for search engines at least once in this paragraph.\n\nMain content\nIt is the main part of your blog post content. Think of the headline as the promise and the main content as the fulfillment of that pledge. Your main content should please anyone who visits your post based on the headline. If you create content that does not meet the promises of your headline, people will start to identify your blog as unfulfilling. The length of your blog posts can range from 300 to 3,000 or more words. It’s best to alternate the length of your posts as you gain insight into what works best for your audience.\n\nSub-headlines\nMany people will scan your blog content as opposed to reading it word for word. Write subheads that break your content into digestible sections. Make sure those subheads represent the content within them.\n\nBolded text\nUse bold text in a few areas of your main content to help highlight important points. Use it selectively. Otherwise, your entire article will seem bolded, thus taking away the ability to highlight key portions of the content.\n\nBulleted/numbered lists\nWhile you don’t want your entire post filled with bullet points or numbers, these lists do help separate out steps and tables with useful content.\n\nMedia\nSupplement the text part of your content with media, such as related images and videos. It will help break up your content and illustrate your points better.\n\nThe least you can do is to include a featured image in your post. Add your post’s main keyword phrase in the filename of the picture as well as the ALT tag. It will help you in search optimization of your post.\n\nConclusion\nThe conclusion should be a paragraph or two at the end of your post to summarize the content you’ve written. The reader should understand what material you’ve covered. If they didn’t, chances are, they will go back to see what they might have missed.\n\nCall-to-action\nThe last line of your blog post should be some form of a call to action. It can be as simple as asking readers to share their thoughts in the comments or to share the post on social media. If you wrote the post to promote a particular product or service, the call to action should encourage the reader to learn more about it.\n\nSocial share buttons\nSocial media is a useful instrument for promoting your blog content. You need to make sure to include social buttons to all your content, so people can easily share it on social networks. You can place them at the top of your content, at the bottom of your content, or on the side, as a floating widget.\n\nComments section\nAside from your blog post content, comments are the most important part of your blog. This section gives your readers an opportunity to interact with you and other visitors. It’s important that you respond to the comments and open the conversation.\n\nYou don’t have to include all the elements from this list in every post. Make sure you always have an engaging introduction, quality content, and a solid conclusion.",
